    The whole dataset consists of 18 simulations. For each,
    two files are required: a zip archiv that contains a number of
    images without any directory, and a csv file that contains three
    columns with the names (as first row):
    filenames,energy
    The filenames must correspond to the the names in the zip archive.

        The dataset consists of images of phase microstructures and the

        of the Cahn-Hilliard model. 
        
        The images are stored in a ZIP archive and will be extracted 'on the
        fly'. There are 17866 images of 64x64 pixels in size.
        
        The microstructures-energy pairs were shuffled, i.e., they do not occur
        in the same order as the evolution of the simulation. If this is 
        required, one can eailsy sort them according to decreasing energy.
